# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm

>The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.

>Process scheduling is an essential part of a Multiprogramming operating systems.

>The OS maintains all PCBs in Process Scheduling Queues. The OS maintains a separate queue for each of the process states and PCBs of all processes in the same execution state are placed in the same queue. When the state of a process is changed, its PCB is unlinked from its current queue and moved to its new state queue.

>The Operating System maintains the following important process scheduling queues − Job queue, Ready queue, Device queues 

>A Process Scheduler schedules different processes to be assigned to the CPU based on particular scheduling algorithms. There are six popular process scheduling algorithms which we are going to discuss in this chapter −

>1. First-Come,First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling, 2. Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) Scheduling, 3. Priority Scheduling, 4. Shortest Remaining Time, 5. Round Robin(RR) Scheduling, 6. Multiple-Level Queues Scheduling
